Since the NN needs the input tensors to be rank 4 tensors because training is doing using the mini batch technique (explained on the training function), the rank 3 $X_t$ tensor is rechaped into a rank 4 X_t tensor such that $X_t = [:, :, t-n:t] = [1, :, :, t-n:t]$ and the $W_{previous}$ vector (rank 1 tensor) is going to be reshaped into a rank 2 one $W_{previous} = (asset_0, asset_1, \\dots , asset_m) = [Assets] = [1, Assets] $.
