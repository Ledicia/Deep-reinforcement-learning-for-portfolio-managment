# Deep-reinforcement-learning-for-portfolio-managment
Exploration of a Deep policy gradient agent in charge of rearranging a financial portfolio comprised of several assets.

This work if a master thesis inspired in the work of https://github.com/ZhengyaoJiang/PGPortfolio. The main difference found on this work with the latter is the approach used to introduce the cash as a non risky asset of the portfolio. 

Concretely, two approaches where studied. The first one includes the cash as a non risky asset, while the second one does not. The idea is to compare the results and evaluate which approach shows a better adaptability to the different trading periods.

The math and financial concepts needed to understand the script can be found on the jupyter notebooks for each of the approaches. Besides, on the folder called documents, a presentation of the master thesis and the thesis itself can be found for a better understanding of the work.
